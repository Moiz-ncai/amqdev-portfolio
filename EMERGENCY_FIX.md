# üö® EMERGENCY FIX - PLACEHOLDER ISSUE

## THE PROBLEM
The website at https://amqdev.com/projects/markit is STILL showing the placeholder text instead of the full MarkIT project details.

## WHY THIS IS HAPPENING
The gh-pages branch has **cached/stale builds** that aren't being replaced by new deployments.

## THE NUCLEAR SOLUTION

### Option 1: Run the Clean Deployment Script (RECOMMENDED)

**For Command Prompt:**
```cmd
cd temp-mobile
deploy-clean.bat
```

**For PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd temp-mobile
.\deploy-clean.ps1
```

This will:
1. Delete all build caches
2. Delete the gh-pages branch (remote & local)
3. Build fresh from scratch
4. Deploy to a brand new gh-pages branch

### Option 2: Manual Nuclear Option

If the scripts fail, do this manually:

```bash
# 1. Clean everything
rmdir /s /q dist
rmdir /s /q .cache
rmdir /s /q node_modules\.vite

# 2. Build fresh
npm run build

# 3. Delete gh-pages branch
git push origin --delete gh-pages
git branch -D gh-pages

# 4. Clear gh-pages cache
rmdir /s /q node_modules\.cache\gh-pages

# 5. Deploy fresh
npx gh-pages -d dist --add
```

### Option 3: GitHub UI Method

If ALL else fails:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Moiz-ncai/amqdev-portfolio/settings/pages
2. Change source from "gh-pages" to "main"
3. Save
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Change back to "gh-pages"
6. Save
7. Wait 2 minutes

## WHAT THE SITE SHOULD SHOW

When you visit https://amqdev.com/projects/markit, you should see:

‚úÖ **Project Overview**
- "MarkIT is a revolutionary AI-powered exam management system..."

‚úÖ **Key Features** (10 items)
- AI-Powered Exam Generation
- Advanced Computer Vision Processing
- ArUco Marker Technology
- etc.

‚úÖ **Technologies Used** (10 items)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- FastAPI with Python
- PyTorch with YOLOv5
- etc.

‚úÖ **Challenges**
- "Building an AI system that could accurately detect..."

‚úÖ **Results & Impact**
- "90% time reduction in exam creation and grading..."

## NOT THIS:
‚ùå "Project Details Coming Soon"
‚ùå "Detailed information about MarkIT will be added here..."

## AFTER DEPLOYMENT

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages CDN to update
2. Visit: https://amqdev.com/projects/markit
3. Do a **HARD REFRESH**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
4. If still showing placeholder, try **Incognito/Private mode**

## WHY THE CLEAN ARCHITECTURE MATTERS

The new centralized data structure in `src/data/projects.ts` IS correct and has all the MarkIT data.

The problem is NOT the code - it's the deployment caching.

Once we force a clean deployment, the issue will be resolved permanently.

## VERIFICATION

After deployment, check the browser console:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Refresh page
- Look for the JavaScript file being loaded
- It should be a NEW file with a different hash

## LAST RESORT

If NOTHING works, we can:
1. Delete the entire gh-pages branch
2. Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
3. This ensures clean builds every time

**Run `deploy-clean.bat` or `deploy-clean.ps1` NOW to fix this!**
